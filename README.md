Terminal Chatbot uses gemini 1.5 flash with an api to fetch results directly from gemini by using the terminal.


This must be installed on your system via pip and you must provide your ownapi key.
This can be achieved by simply running: `pip3 install .` in the root directory of the package


Once you have installed the package, run: `chatbot (your message)` in terminal
